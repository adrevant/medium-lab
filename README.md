# medium-lab

Welcome to medium-lab, a sandbox of code experiments, demos, and mini-projects that complement my blog posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@brendavarguez21). If you've landed here from one of my articles, you're in the right place to explore the code behind the concepts.

Whether it's data engineering, ocean tech, or a Swiftie-coded take on APIs, this repo is the backstage pass to all the practical magic.

> [!NOTE]
> This repo is continuously evolving as I write new content. Some folders may be incomplete, experimental, or slightly chaotic, just like most good ideas at the start. Feel free to explore, clone, and experiment!

## ✨ What's Inside

Each folder in this repo corresponds to a (set of) Medium article. You'll find:

- 🧾 Notebooks & scripts: Hands-on code examples
- 📁 Sample data: Small datasets (when available) to help you run things locally
- 🛠️ Setup instructions: Readmes or comments to help you get started
- 🧠 Thought Process: Sometimes messy, always honest
